Welcome to the repository of my "Math Game" project! Here, I created an interactive math arena, challenging users to tackle the 1 times table in phase 1 and progress to phase 10. Prove that you are the master of multiplication and that the only thing that divides by zero here is your enthusiasm!

</p>

This project is an educational game that aims to make learning multiplication tables more engaging and fun. Players can create a user, take on math challenges, and level up as they master multiplication.

## Technologies Used

- **VB.net:** A versatile, object-oriented programming language.
- **Windows Forms:** A set of tools for developing graphical interfaces in the Windows environment.

## Functionalities

1. **Math Arena:**
    - Take on multiplication challenges in an interactive arena.

2. **Progressive Phases:**
    - Progress through the levels, facing more challenging times tables as you go.

3. **User Creation:**
    - Create a custom username to track your progress and achievements.

4. **Score Control:**
    - Score is recorded as the player completes each challenge.

## How to Test

###Download

- [V1.0](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/math-game/releases/tag/v1.0)

### Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/mathgame.git
    ```

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio:**
